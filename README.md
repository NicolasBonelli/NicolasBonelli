### üß† [Company Assistant](https://github.com/NicolasBonelli/QAHelper)  
**AI Engineer** | June 2025 ‚Äì Aug 2025 
Co-developed Company Assistant, a multi-agent chatbot platform designed to help companies automate customer support and internal workflows. The system orchestrates multiple LLM-driven agents using LangGraph and LangChain, enabling reasoning, document retrieval, and contextual memory. 
Integrated LlamaIndex with semantic chunking for knowledge retrieval, and PostgreSQL with pgvector on AWS RDS for long-term conversational and knowledge storage. Used MCP (Model Context Protocol) to standardize tool access, FastMCP to expose custom tools, and Guardrails-AI to enforce content moderation. CI/CD
pipelines were set up with GitHub Actions, and the backend was implemented with FastAPI. The system also leverages AWS S3 for document storage and RabbitMQ for pipeline orchestration.

**Tech:** Python, LangGraph, MCP, Gemini LLM, LlamaIndex, PostgreSQL + pgvector, AWS RDS, Semantic Chunking, Multi-Agent Architectures

### üíº [Job Searcher](https://github.com/NicolasBonelli/jobFinder)
